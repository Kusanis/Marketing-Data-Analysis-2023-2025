Baby Smile Marketing Data Analysis (2023-2025)This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Msc_Project_Work.ipynb) that performs an in-depth analysis of marketing data for "Baby Smile" and its competitors from 2023 to 2025. The project aims to understand various aspects of sales, revenue, and advertising spend across different regions, age groups, and product categories.Table of ContentsProject OverviewDatasetKey FeaturesInstallationUsageContributingLicenseProject OverviewThis project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive marketing dataset to derive insights into "Baby Smile" and its competitors' performance. The analysis includes exploring sales trends, revenue generation, and the impact of various marketing channels (e.g., TV, Radio, OOH, Meta Ads, Google Ads, Influencer Marketing) on overall business metrics. The notebook utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Scikit-learn for potential linear regression modeling.DatasetThe analysis is based on the baby_smile_marketing_data_with_competitors_2023_2025.xlsx Excel file, which is expected to be located in the /content/ directory if running in a Colab environment. The dataset contains 292,400 rows and 30 columns, covering marketing activities and performance from April 2023 to March 2025.Key Columns:date: Date of the recordregion: Geographical regionage_group: Consumer age groupcategory: Product category (e.g., Diaper, Baby Food, Skin Care, Clothes)brand: Brand name (e.g., BABY SMILE, Kuchela, Baby Naughty, Hug Me)sales: Sales figuresRevenue: Revenue generatedspend_tv: Spend on TV advertisingspend_radio: Spend on Radio advertisingspend_ooh: Spend on Out-of-Home advertisingspend_meta_ads: Spend on Meta (Facebook/Instagram) adsspend_google_ads: Spend on Google Adsspend_taboola_ads: Spend on Taboola adsspend_programmatic_ads: Spend on Programmatic adsspend_connected_tv: Spend on Connected TV adsspend_email: Spend on Email marketingspend_sms: Spend on SMS marketingspend_whatsapp_marketing: Spend on WhatsApp marketingspend_print_ads_newspapers: Spend on Newspaper print adsspend_print_ads_magazines: Spend on Magazine print adsspend_direct_buy: Spend on Direct Buy campaignsspend_influencer_marketing: Spend on Influencer Marketingday_of_week: Day of the weekmonth: Monthyear: Yearquarter: Quarter of the yearspend_natural_search: Spend on Natural Searchspend_direct_traffic: Spend on Direct TrafficTotal Ad Spend: Total advertising spendspend_referral_traffic: Spend on Referral TrafficKey FeaturesData Loading and Inspection: Initial loading and examination of the dataset structure, columns, and data types.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Renaming columns for consistency and ease of use (e.g., spend_tv ('00s) to spend_tv, sales ('0000s) to sales).Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand sales trends, revenue performance, and advertising effectiveness.Marketing Mix Modeling (Potential): The presence of LinearRegression suggests an intention to model the relationship between marketing spend and outcomes like sales or revenue.InstallationTo run this notebook, you'll need a Python environment with the following libraries installed:pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn openpyxl
